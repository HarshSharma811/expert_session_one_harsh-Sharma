# Data Preparation

In this notebook we will prepare our data for our search function to use.
Currently we have data stored in mentiond below csv file.
    * netflixData.csv

# Import the needed modules...
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict
from os import getcwd

# Data Engineering
    *Get data in dataframes.


"""
    Read data from netflixData.csv
"""
df_movies            = pd.read_csv(netflixData.csv)
df = df.fillna("unavailable")
netflixData_table_columns = df_movies.columns.tolist()
print(f"COLUMNS : {neyflixData_table_columns}")

# A user will always search a movie by its title, Director, Genres, Casts so we will create a Global secondary index to be able to perform search our datastore.

#it will obviously take some extra space but almost negligible as compared to the size of the original data.
In addition, It will make our searching faster and efficient so it's a good deal.

# Now we may create the list of mentioned column to make your search less time consuming: 
    1) now we will create the list of Titles
    2) now we will create the list of Titles,Diresctore,Genres by seperate them.

# Now we will make directories to store the data through which we   can search easily and attach their respective info with them in the dictionary

# Now we will import json and 
storing and transmitting accros a network the data that we have stored in the dictionary
